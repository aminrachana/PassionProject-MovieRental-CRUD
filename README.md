# PassionProject-MovieRental-CRUD

<p>RedBox Movie Rental is designed for Movie Rentals, developed using Entity 
Framework, that is used to manage the movies rented out by the stores, as well as 
the list of rentals. Movie rental is more flexibility to support the customers and 
enabling them to enjoy the movies in comfort of their own homes.</p>
